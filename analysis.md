# Migration Analysis Document

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive analysis of migrating our SharePoint on-premise application to a more modern infrastructure. It aims to compare the viability, costs, and benefits of two potential migration paths: a .NET/React stack versus SharePoint Online with the SharePoint Framework (SPFx).

### Scope
This document outlines the estimated timelines, resources, benefits, and risks associated with each migration path. It serves as a foundational guide for stakeholders to make an informed decision on the optimal migration strategy for our application.

## 2. Project Overview

### Current State
Our current application is built on SharePoint on-premise, utilizing custom JavaScript solutions for functionality. It includes several lists for application data and uses SharePoint groups for permission management.

### Desired State
The goal of the migration is to enhance application performance, improve user experience with modern web technologies, achieve better integration with cloud services, and ensure scalability for future needs.

## 3. Migration Paths Analysis

### .NET/React Stack Migration

#### Overview
This migration path involves transitioning our application to a modern architecture using .NET for the backend and React for the frontend, providing a decoupled, scalable solution.

#### Estimated Timeline: 23-35 weeks
- Requirements Gathering: 1-2 weeks
- Design & Architecture Planning: 2-3 weeks
- Backend & Frontend Development: 10-14 weeks
- Data Migration & Testing: 5-7 weeks
- Deployment & Transition: 3-4 weeks
- Training & Documentation: 1-2 weeks

#### Required Resources
- Development Team: .NET and React developers, QA engineers, a project manager
- Tools & Services: Visual Studio, Node.js, GitHub, Azure DevOps
- Infrastructure: Azure App Service for hosting, Azure SQL Database

#### Benefits
- High flexibility and customization
- Enhanced performance and user experience
- Broader integration capabilities with external APIs and services

#### Risks and Considerations
- Higher initial development effort and costs
- Requires comprehensive testing to ensure stability
- Maintenance overhead for separate backend and frontend

### SharePoint Online SPFx Migration

#### Overview
Migrating to SharePoint Online and utilizing SPFx for custom development allows leveraging cloud capabilities and tight integration with the Microsoft ecosystem.

#### Estimated Timeline: 23-36 weeks
- Analysis & Planning: 2-3 weeks
- SPFx Solution Development: 4-6 weeks
- Permissions & Workflow Configuration: 3-4 weeks
- Data Migration: 2-4 weeks
- Testing & Validation: 3-4 weeks
- Deployment & Transition: 2-3 weeks
- Training & Documentation: 1-2 weeks

#### Required Resources
- Development Team: SharePoint/SPFx developers, QA engineers, a project manager
- Tools & Services: SharePoint Online, Microsoft 365 suite, Power Automate
- Infrastructure: Primarily managed by Microsoft

#### Benefits
- Reduced infrastructure management
- Seamless integration with Microsoft services
- Built-in security and compliance features

#### Risks and Considerations
- Limited by SharePoint Online and SPFx capabilities
- Dependency on Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem and policies
- Potential learning curve for SPFx

## 4. Comparative Analysis

- **Cost**: Initial costs are potentially higher for the .NET/React stack due to development and hosting. SharePoint Online may incur less upfront cost but has ongoing subscription fees.
- **Time to Market**: Similar timelines, but SPFx might have a slight edge due to existing SharePoint infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: .NET/React offers more flexibility and customization options.
- **Scalability**: Both options provide scalability, but .NET/React might edge out with more control over performance optimization.
- **Integration**: While both support external integrations, .NET/React provides broader options outside the Microsoft ecosystem.

## 5. Recommendation

Considering the need for flexibility, control over the technology stack, and the desire for a modern, scalable solution, the .NET/React stack migration path is recommended. This approach offers a future-proof architecture that can adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements.

## 6. Conclusion

Migrating our SharePoint on-premise application is a strategic move to enhance our technological foundation. The detailed analysis supports the decision to adopt a .NET/React stack, balancing immediate needs with long-term growth and innovation.
